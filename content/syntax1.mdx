## Syntax - Level 1 (W2)
####  - Q1 -

It asks us to write these equations in MATLAB. First, we can eliminate the wrong ones, in MATLAB after an `if` statement we use `elseif` statement to add another condition so we can eliminate option A, B and C. We have D and E options left. There is only one different in these options, `&&` and `&`. Both are logical `AND` operations. The `&&` though, is a "short-circuit" operator. 

From the MATLAB documentation: "They are short-circuit operators in that they evaluate their second operand only when the result is not fully determined by the first operand."

For example:

A & B (A and B are evaluated)

A && B (B is only evaluated if A is true)

Correct answer is `E`.

`x & y` performs a logical `AND` of arrays x and y and returns an array containing elements set to either logical 1 (true) or logical 0 (false). An element of the output array is set to logical 1 (true) if both x and y contain a **nonzero** element at that same array location. Otherwise, the array element is set to 0.

`~y = not(y)` returns a logical array of the same size as y. The array contains logical 1 (true) values where **y is zero** and logical 0 (false) values where **y is nonzero**. So in our question it gives us an array of full zero because given y has nonzero elements.

`x&(~y)` returns a logical array of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] because we are taking their intersection. For this `&` operator to return a nonzero number, we need nonzero numbers both from x and y. 

Correct answer is `C`

A polyline is a list of points, where line segments are drawn between consecutive points.

While plotting, we can use different styles to plot our graph. There are some shorcuts for colors such as `r` is for red, `g` is for green etc. Also there are some shortcuts for line styles such as `-` is for solid line, `--` is for dashed line, `:` is for dotted line etc. 

Correct answer is `A`.

From MATLAB documentation: `clc` clears all the text from the Command Window, resulting in a clear screen. 

Correct answer is `A`

####  - Q5 -

In this question, we were asked 10 **sub-intervals**. linspace function creates n points between x and y but it creates n-1 sub-intervals between x and y points. So for this question, we need to choose linspace(-1,1,11) to get a 10 subintervals. 

Correct answer is `C` 

####  - Q6 -
![](/questions/syntax-level1/syntaxlevel1-6.png "Q6")

In this question, to divide the interval into `N` sub-intervals we need to use linspace(x,y,n+1) because linspace divides the intervals into n-1 sub-intervals but we need N amount of sub-intervals. We need to read carefully. 

Correct answer is `D`

####  - Q7 -

From MATLAB documentation: `clear` removes all variables from the current workspace, releasing them from system memory. `clear` removes a global variable from the current workspace but not other workspaces. 

Correct answer is `B`

####  - Q8 -
![](/questions/syntax-level1/syntaxlevel1-8.png "Q8")

`A == B` returns a logical array with elements set to logical 1 (true) where arrays A and B are equal; otherwise, the element is logical 0 (false). In this question fourth elements and seventh elements of x and y is equal so the answer will be [0 0 0 1 0 0 1]. 

Correct answer is `C`

####  - Q9 -

From MATLAB documentation: A./B divides each element of A by the corresponding element of B. A and B must have compatible sizes. In the simplest cases, they can be the same size or one can be a scalar. 

Correct answer is `A`

####  - Q10 -

From MATLAB documentation: contour(Z) creates a contour plot containing the isolines of matrix Z, where Z contains height values on the x-y plane. MATLABÂ® automatically selects the contour lines to display. The column and row indices of Z are the x and y coordinates in the plane, respectively.

Correct answer is `D`

####  - Q11 -

`.^`  Array power. From MATLAB documentation: "A.^B denotes element-by-element powers. A and B must have compatible sizes. In the simplest cases, they can be the same size or one can be a scalar." We can eliminate option B, C and E from this definition. For option D, it doesn't needs to be n x n, we can use `.^` operator with 2 x 3 and 1 x 3 matrices so we can eliminate D. 

Correct answer is `A`

####  - Q12 -

From MATLAB documentation: "`>`  Greater than operator. A > B does element by element comparisons between A and B and returns an array with elements set to logical 1 (TRUE) where the relation is true and elements set to logical 0 (FALSE) where it is not." 

Correct answer is `E`

####  - Q13 -

For this kind of questions, we need to be careful for small details. Question asked us to plot the function in an interval. We have x values in [1, 2] interval so we will use `plot` function because while using `fplot` function we define a function generally and let MATLAB choose the x values and compute the y values. With this information, we can eliminate `fplot`, options B and E. In options A and C, there are typos in y function, it needs to be `y=x.^2+log(x)`. Be careful while using `.^`operator. 

Correct answer is `D`

Unlike other code languages Python and Javascript, in MATLAB indexing starts from 1. To get an index from given x vector, simply we can use `x(start index : number of steps : end index)`. 

Correct answer is `A`

####  - Q15 -
![](/questions/syntax-level1/syntaxlevel1-15.png "Q15")

From MATLAB documentation: 
```
while expression
    statements
end

For example: 
while n > 1
    n = n-1;
end
```
Correct answer is `D`
