## Numerical Computing MATLAB Questions

This website contains MATLAB questions and solutions from the Linear Algebra and Geometry course at Politecnico di Torino.

It started as a simple idea while we were preparing for the MATLAB exam — we began taking notes on the problems we encountered. As our collection grew, we thought it might be helpful to share it publicly so that others studying for the same exam could benefit too.

The questions are sourced from Polito’s exam portal, and we've done our best to break them down with clear, student-friendly explanations. We hope this resource helps make your preparation easier and more effective.

### Subjects(Total `77` question) 
The course subjects divided into 7 sub-subjects in portale.

Syntax - Level 1 (W2)

Sytanx - Level 2 (W2)

Machine Arithmetic (W2)

Interpolation (W5)

Linear Systems - 1 (W9)

Linear Systems - 2 (W9)

Eigenvalues and matrix factorizations (W14)


A note from Professor;

1. Questions should **not be considered exhaustive of the course program**. Moreover, some questions are proposed with a high level of heterogeneity in terms of complexity.
2. The scores assigned during these quizzes are not related to the difficulty of the question.
3. Use the online help to understand the use of MATLAB commands that you have never dealt with.
4. You may repeat the quiz several times; typically new questions will be delivered.
5. The due time is not related to question number and/or complexity, and it is not related to the time you will be assigned for completing the quiz during the exam.
6. The different number of alternatives (4 in some cases, 5 in other ones) is not significant. The questions of the final test will have 5 alternatives.
7. For each quiz, we provide a qualitative indication of the course week in which the treatment of the topics is approximately completed so that you should be able to answer all questions in the quiz (for example W1 -> starting from week one; W4 -> starting from week four, and so on).
